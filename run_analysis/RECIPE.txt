======================================
The script run-analysis.R takes raw data on activity trackers and returns a tidy data set.  
This RECIPE provides the step-by-step process to achieve the tidy data set.
run_analysis.R:
1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	The following files are read into R using read.table:
		1. features.txt , This file is then converted to character with as.character and subsetted to only keep the second column (the feature names)
		2. activity_labels.txt
		3. subject_train.txt
		4. y_train.txt 
		5. X_train.txt
		6. subject_test.txt
		7. y_test.txt
		8. X_test
	The training data is combined into one data set using cbind.
	Similarly, The test data is combined into one data set using cbind.
	The training data and test data are combined into one data set using rbind. 
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	Assigned descriptive labels to columns of combined data set using colnames from Features list.  
	Subsets the combined raw data to keep only columns with strings "SubjectID", "Activity", or any Features with "mean" or "std" in label using grep.
	Note: Only measurements ending in "-mean()" or "-std()" were considered.  For instance, "-meanFreq" was excluded.
	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	Converted Activity column to character, then assigned descriptive activity label.  Activity column converted back to factor.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
	Completed in Step 2.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	Used dplyer package to group by individual subject, then by activity.  Used summarise_each (funs(mean)) to find the summary of each column by each group_by row (SubjectID by Activity).
	This provides the tidy data set. 
	Used write.table to create text file, tidy_data.txt.
